Topics include SQL, data cleaning, visualization, and an introduction to machine learning concepts. Students will complete hands-on labs using Python and PostgreSQL throughout the semester.

LEARNING OUTCOMES
By the end of the course, students will be able to:
1. Design and query relational databases using SQL.
2. Clean, transform, and prepare datasets for analysis using Python (pandas).
3. Create data visualizations using Matplotlib and Seaborn.
4. Apply basic descriptive and inferential statistics to data problems.
5. Critically evaluate data sources for bias, completeness, and reliability.

REQUIRED MATERIALS
- Textbook: "Data Science for Business" by Provost & Fawcett (O'Reilly, 2nd ed.)
- Software: Python 3.11+, PostgreSQL 15, Jupyter Notebook (all free; install guide on LMS)
- All lecture slides and datasets are posted on the LMS within 24 hours of class.

Assignments submitted 24–72 hours late receive a 25% deduction.
No assignments will be accepted more than 72 hours after the deadline without a documented medical or family emergency approved in advance by the instructor.
Quizzes cannot be made up except in cases of documented medical emergencies notified before the quiz date.
The final project deadline is firm. No extensions will be granted.

ACADEMIC INTEGRITY
All submitted work must be your own. Use of AI-generated code or text without attribution is considered academic dishonesty and will be handled under the College Academic Integrity Policy (Policy 4.2.1). Students may use AI tools as a learning aid but must document their use in a brief note at the top of any submission where AI assisted.

ACCESSIBILITY
Students requiring accommodations must submit their Accessibility Services documentation to the instructor within the first two weeks of class. Retroactive accommodations will not be applied to assessments already completed.

COMMUNICATION POLICY
The instructor aims to respond to all emails within 48 business hours. For urgent matters, students should visit office hours. Group questions are best directed to the class discussion board on the LMS, where other students may also benefit from the answer.
